Generates a new profile.

The argument is the name of the profile, either in CamelCase or in snake_case
form. It can be prefixed with namespace(s) in/this/form or In::This::Form. It is
not necessary to add the bundle namespace in front (it gets added automatically)

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen profile sensing/localization

  will generate a RockAuv::Profiles::Sensing::Localization profile in
  models/profiles/sensing/localization.rb, and the associated
  test template in test/profiles/sensing/test_localization.rb. The files up in
  the hierarchy (here models/profiles/sensing.rb and
  test/profiles/suite_sensing.rb) are updated to require the new file(s).
