Generates a new extension file for an oroGen project. It must be given the name
of the oroGen project as argument.

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen orogen auv_control

  will create a template extension file in models/orogen/auv_control.rb, which
  already contains the definitions of the tasks found in the auv_control oroGen
  project. It also generates an associated test file in test/orogen/test_auv_control.rb
