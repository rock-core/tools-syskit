    # Base class for models that represent components (TaskContext,
    # Composition)
    #
    # The model-level methods (a.k.a. singleton methods) are defined on
    # Models::Component). See the documentation of Model for an explanation of
    # this.
    #
    # Components may be data service providers. Two types of data sources
    # exist:
    # * main services are root data services that can be provided
    #   independently
    # * slave sources are data services that depend on another service. For
    #   instance, an ImageProvider source of a StereoCamera task could be
    #   slave of the main PointCloudProvider source.
    #
    # Data services are referred to by name. In the case of a main service,
    # its name is the name used during the declaration. In the case of slave
    # services, it is main_data_service_name.slave_name. I.e. the name of
    # the slave service depends on the selected
