        # TaskContext instances may be associated with a Deployment task, that

        # context and its deployment is usually represented by an executed_by

        # The task configuration step is managed as follows:
        #
        # * all tasks start with executable? and setup? returning false
        # * the engine will call #setup to configure the task if it is in the
        #   main plan. If the actual orocos task was already setup, #setup will
        #   actually do nothing. At this stage, executable? is still false
        # * executable? will be true only if the task is configured *and* all
        #   static inputs are connected.
